# dsa-codes

A small repository containing Java examples for common data-structures and algorithms problems.

## Important Questions

I added a folder `important_questions` with several commonly asked DSA problems implemented in Java. See `important_questions/README.md` for details and examples.

To compile and run the examples:

```bash
javac important_questions/*.java
java -cp . important_questions.TwoSum
```

Replace the class name at the end to run other examples.
